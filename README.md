# chess_for_html_canvas
Chess game for html pages in js.

This is one of my first projects.
The conception is a PvP chess game on the same platform (in the same browser). 
I'm loking forward to make it multiplatform and create a desktop version of it in C++/QT.
In the future it will be developed fully (there are some deficiencies in the game logic).
Also want to create a version that is not only PvP but contains a chess engine to singleplayer mode (My competitions are under this leve right now).
Hope you enjoy!
