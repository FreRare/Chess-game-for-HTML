# Multiplayer PvP chess game
Chess game for html pages in js.

This is one of my first projects.
The conception is a PvP chess game on the same platform (in the same browser). 
I'm looking forward to make it real PvP and also create a desktop version of it in C++/QT.
In the future it will be developed fully (there are some deficiencies in the game logic [Castleing is not available in the game right now]).
Also want to create a version that is not only PvP but contains a chess engine to singleplayer mode (My competitions are under this level right now).
Hope you enjoy!


# USAGE:
The game works in every html page, it only needs two "div" elements, the rest is generated dynamically but you have to add the div IDs in the source code (For further information check out the "chess_board.js" file).
